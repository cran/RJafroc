## Introduction
This vignette is intended for those seeking a quick transiton from Windows *JAFROC* to *RJafroc*.
It is assumed that the user is familiar with the *JAFROC* data format and can analyze a dataset using the
Windows program. First, let me describe the structure in `R` of an `RJafroc` dataset. Later I will tell you
how to read a *JAFROC*  format file to create an `RJafroc` dataset.

## An ROC dataset
Let us start with a predefined dataset `{dataset3}` corresponding to the Franken ROC data.
Let us examine the structure of this dataset.

```{r}
str(dataset03)
```             

It shows a list with 8 members. The false positive ratings are contained in `{NL}`, an array
with dimensions `[1:2,1:4,1:100,1]`. The first index corresponds to treatments, and since the 
dataset has 2 treatments, the corresponding dimension is 2. The second index corresponds to 
readers, and since the dataset has 4 readers, the corresponding dimension is 4. The third index 
corresponds to the total number of cases. Since the dataset has 100 cases, the corresponding 
dimension is 100. But, as you can see from the code below, the entries in this array for cases 34
through 100 are `-Inf`. 

```{r}
dataset03$NL[1,1,34:100,1]
``` 

This is because in the ROC paradigm false positive are not possible on diseased cases. So the actual
FP ratings are contained in the first 33 elements of the array. How did I know that there are 34
non-diseased cases? This can be understood in several ways.

* `LL` is an array with dimensions `[1:2,1:4,1:67,1]`. This implies 67 diseased cases, and by 
    subtraction from 100, there must be 34 non-diseased cases.
* The list members `lesionNum`, `lesionID` and `lesionWeight` are all arrays with dimensions
    `[1:67,1]` containing ones. Again, these imply 67 diseased cases.
* The fields `lesionNum`, `lesionID` and `lesionWeight`, while not needed for ROC data, 
    are needed, as we shall see later, for the FROC paradigm.

The `dataType` list member is the character string `"ROC"`,
    characterizing the ROC dataset. Alternatives are `"FROC"` and `"LROC"`.
    
```{r}
dataset03$dataType
``` 

The `modalityID` list member is a character string with two entries, "0" and "1",
    corresponding to the two treatments (i.e., modalities). These can be longer
    strings, if you  please, that label the two treatments.
    
```{r}
dataset03$modalityID
``` 

The `readerID` list member is a character string with four entries, "0",  "1", "2" and "3"
    corresponding to the four readers. These can be longer
    strings that label the four readers.
```{r}
dataset03$readerID
``` 


Here are the actual ratings for cases 1:34.


```{r}
dataset03$NL[1,1,1:34,1]
``` 

This says that for treatment 1 and reader 1, (non-diseased) case 1 was rated 3, case 3 was rated 2,
case 8 was rated 4, etc. The `-Inf` corresponds to the cases rated 1, which is is equivalent to a 1-rating.
The reason for this is that the ratings are ordered labels. As far as the ordering is concerned, nothing is
changed be replacing `-Inf` with 1 and vice-versa.

As another example, for treatment 2 and reader 3, 

```{r}
dataset03$NL[2,3,1:34,1]
``` 

As you can see, there are no cases that are explicitly rated 1, so changing the `-Inf` to 1 does not change 
the ordering of the ratings.

## Creating a dataset from a JAFROC format file

There is a file `includedRocData.xlsx` that is part of the package intallation. Since it is a system
file one must get its name as follows.

```{r}
fileName <- "includedRocData.xlsx"
sysFileName <- system.file(paste0("extdata/",fileName), package = "RJafroc", mustWork = TRUE)
``` 

Next, one uses DfReadDataFile() as follows, assuming it is a JAFROC format file.

```{r}
ds <- DfReadDataFile(sysFileName)
``` 

Now ds is the desired dataset.

```{r}
str(ds)
``` 

Analysis is illustrated for `dataset03`, but one could have used the newly created 
dataset `ds`.

## Analyzing the ROC dataset

This illustrates the `StSignificanceTesting()` function. The significance testing method is specified as `"DBMH"`
and the figure of merit `FOM` is specified as "Wilcoxon".

```{r}
ret <- StSignificanceTesting(dataset03, method = "DBMH", FOM = "Wilcoxon")
print(ret)
```             

## Explanation of the output
The function returns a long unwieldy list. Let us consider them one by one.
The function `UtilOutputReport()` can generate an Excel file report, making it much
easier to visualize the results. This is described in another vignette.

### FOMs
* `fomArray` contains the `[1:2,1:4]` FOM values.

```{r}
ret$fomArray
```             


This shows the 2 x 4 array of FOM values. 

### Pseudovalue ANOVA table

* `anovaY`, where the Y denotes that these are pseudovalue based, 
is the ANOVA table.


```{r}
ret$anovaY
```             

### Pseudovalue ANOVA table, each treatment

* `anovaYi` is the ANOVA table for individual treatments.


```{r}
ret$anovaYi
```             

The 0 and 1 headers come from the treatment names.

### Pseudovalue Variance Components

* `varComp` is the variance components (needed for sample
size estimation).


```{r}
ret$varComp
```             

### Random-reader random-case (RRRC) analysis

* `fRRRC` is the F-statistic for testing the NH that the
treatments have identical FOMs. RRRC means random-reader random-case generalization.


```{r}
ret$fRRRC

```{r}
ret$pRRRC
```

* `ciDiffTrtRRRC` is the 95% confidence interval of
reader-averaged differences between treatments.

random-case analysis.


```{r}
ret$fFRRC
```             

* `ndf` is the numerator degrees of freedom of the F-statistic,
always one less than the number of treatments.


```{r}
ret$ndf
```             

* `ddfFRRC` is the denominator degreesof freedom of the F-statistic,
for fixed-reader random-case analysis.
